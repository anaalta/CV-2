# CV
## Susan Graham
I am an extremely positive, go-getting individual - I thrive on challenging experiences and learning new things. My experience at Makers has engrained in me the importance of best coding practices, and this is my biggest priority in looking for a junior developer role - working in a supportive environment where those practices are prioritised where I can flourish as a developer. I’d like a front-end role working in a medium-sized team.


### Skills

#### Excited by a challenge
After studying art at school, I moved to Paris in the footsteps of the artistic greats. Economic realities quickly led me back to study at University, but my experience living abroad spurned a desire in me for greater exploration, and after university, feeling more adventurous, I moved to Russia, where I lived for four years. Surviving the harsh Russian winter as well as the reality of living in a foreign land was a challenge which I embraced, and it was in this spirit that I applied to Makers Academy to begin life as a developer.

#### Fast Learner
My love of a challenge also means that I have to be a fast learner. When I moved to Paris, I was able to communicate fluently in French within several months, and then I studied Politics at university which was a subject I’d never studied before. Living abroad meant that I quickly had to adapt to another country’s culture and learn the language in order to prosper. My ability to learn quickly has served me well at Makers and something which I am hoping to bring to a junior developer role.

#### Driving force
I have the ability to find what’s exciting about a project, and bring this enthusiasm to a whole team. My final project team-mates credited my positive influence as being a crucial aspect to our project success. I also have the perseverance to get things done and to keep going with a problem until it is solved.

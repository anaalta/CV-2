As a creative individual, I love working on projects and seeing them come to life, whether that's a scribble that becomes a storyboard, or a JavaScript snippet that inspires a fully fledged web app.

I am a creative junior developer looking for a front-end role.

For the past four years, I have lived and worked in Russia. Surviving the harsh Russian winter as well as the reality of living in a foreign land was a challenge which I embraced, and it was in this spirit that I applied to <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a>, where I have been making fun projects (like <a href="https://codey-gonzalez.herokuapp.com/games">this one</a>) in order to kick-start my career as a developer.
My experience at Makers Academy has engrained in me the importance of best coding practices, and this is my biggest priority in looking for a junior developer role. I'd love to work in a supportive environment where those practices are followed.


## SKILLS

#### Initiative
When I moved to Russia I had no contacts there, but within a year I was working as a self-employed tutor, growing my own client base through delivering a professional service and being a personable tutor.

#### Team driving force
I have the ability to find what is exciting about a project, and bring this enthusiasm to a whole team. My final project team-mates credited my positive influence as being a crucial aspect to our project success(see <a href="http://slides.com/roadtocode/deck/fullscreen#/">video</a>). I also have the perseverance to get things done and to keep going with a problem until it is solved.

After five years of living and working abroad, I wanted a new challenge, and as a creative individual, becoming a developer really appealed to me. I love working on projects and seeing them come to life, whether that's a scribble that becomes a storyboard, or a JavaScript snippet that inspires a fully fledged web app.

Since June 2016, I have been studying at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a>, a developer bootcamp, where I have been learning fundamentals of software development through making fun projects (like <a href="https://codey-gonzalez.herokuapp.com/games">this one</a>). My experience at Makers Academy has engrained in me the importance of best coding practices, and this is my biggest priority in looking for a junior developer role. I'd love to work in a supportive environment where those practices are followed.


## SKILLS

#### Initiative
After university, I was offered a job as an English teacher in Moscow. Despite initially having had no contacts there, within a year I was working as a self-employed tutor. My professionalism and hard-work meant I was able to build and maintain a large network of students.

#### Team driving force
I have the ability to find what is exciting about a project, and bring this enthusiasm to a whole team. My final project team-mates credited my positive influence as being a crucial aspect to our project success(see <a href="http://slides.com/roadtocode/deck/fullscreen#/">video</a>). I also have the perseverance to get things done and to keep going with a problem until it is solved.
